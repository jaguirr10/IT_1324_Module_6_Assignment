A long time ago, in a galaxy not so far, far away....
The University System of Georgia embarked on a mission to 
merge SPSU with Kennesaw State University.
It is a period of transition. While
many remain skeptical, it is imperative to trust
The Force. The new U will emerge officially in Fall 2015
and rest assured that good will triumph over evil.  
While the name of SPSU will be retired into history, 
the spirit of the faculty, staff and students will 
remain.  As the new U arises, so will the power of the 
spirit of SPSU in its new realm.  So, as future custodians 
of the spirit of SPSU, keep the faith and remain true ...
for now and always SPSU and Yoda Rock!
